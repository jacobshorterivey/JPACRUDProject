## JPA CRUD Project

### Week 9 Homework Project for Skill Distillery

### Overview
This week's assignment was to design a web application that utilizes a MySQL database we created, while manipulating the database's information with JPA. The user should be able to do full CRUD on the database through the web application.

### Technologies/Topics Applied
This project required me to use MySQL, JPA, Spring MVC, Spring Boot, JSP files, Gradle, and HTML/CSS. Topics applied included managing entities, understanding the "model view controller" concept, and integrating Spring Boot into our web applications.

### Lessons Learned
The assignment this week gave me an actual feel for how designing a full stack web application from scratch would be. Creating the database, modeling the entity, and passing it's information to the relevant .JSPs using controllers was simple in the end, but I did have to get used to the process and reread some of the given material. I thought the ability for JPA to handle entity mangagement simplified the process and made all of my code a bit more readable.
